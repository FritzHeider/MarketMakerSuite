Master Prompt: Modular, Scalable Market-Making Bot MVP
Objective: Design and implement a cloud-based, modular market-making bot as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), with maximum functionality and scalability using APIs and cloud infrastructure. The bot should be user-friendly, capable of real-time market-making, and provide the foundation for future enhancements like advanced AI/ML modules, compliance tools, and backtesting systems. Prioritize modularity, maintainability, and integration.

Categorization of Modules
1. Front End Modules
* Purpose: Enable user interaction, real-time monitoring, and control through intuitive interfaces and actionable insights.
* Modules:
   1. GUI (Graphical User Interface): Centralized dashboard to monitor market activities, visualize arbitrage opportunities, track orders, and analyze portfolio performance.
   2. NotificationModule: Sends alerts for important events such as arbitrage opportunities, trade executions, and risk threshold breaches.
2. Back End Modules
* Purpose: Manage all core logic, decision-making, and integrations with external systems (e.g., exchanges, APIs, and databases).
* Modules:
   1. DataFeedModule: Handles real-time and historical market data ingestion from multiple exchanges.
   2. PricingStrategyModule: Computes bid/ask prices dynamically using predefined strategies and integrates with AI/ML models for optimization.
   3. RiskManagementModule: Enforces risk constraints like order size limits, position exposure, and stop-loss mechanisms.
   4. OrderManagementModule: Facilitates order placement, modification, and cancellation on multiple exchanges.
   5. ArbitrageModule: Identifies profitable arbitrage opportunities by calculating price differences across exchanges and factoring in fees, slippage, and latency.
   6. PortfolioManagementModule: Tracks user balances, open positions, PnL (profit and loss), and historical performance.
   7. LoggingMonitoringSystem: Logs all decisions, actions, and system metrics for auditing, debugging, and monitoring.
3. Supporting Infrastructure
* Purpose: Provide scalability, persistence, aggregation, and advanced functionality.
* Modules:
   1. CentralServer: Aggregates anonymized data (e.g., trading fees, gas fees) from users to optimize arbitrage calculations and fee estimations.
   2. BacktestingModule: Simulates trading strategies against historical data for optimization and validation.
   3. MachineLearningModule (Planned): Uses AI to predict trends, identify optimal pricing strategies, and optimize arbitrage logic.
   4. ComplianceModule (Planned): Ensures adherence to regulations, including KYC/AML compliance and tax reporting.
