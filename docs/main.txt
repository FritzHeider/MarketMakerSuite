Modular Market-Making Bot MVP: Architecture and Tech Stack

For a modular market-making bot MVP, with maximum functionality implemented through APIs and the cloud, the system is categorized into Front End, Back End, and Supporting Infrastructure modules.

Categorization of Modules

1. Front End Modules

These are user-facing components responsible for interactions and visualizations:

GUI: Provides a dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.

NotificationModule: Sends alerts and updates to the user.

2. Back End Modules

These handle core logic, decision-making, and integrations with external systems:

DataFeedModule: Fetches real-time and historical market data.

PricingStrategyModule: Calculates bid/ask prices using predefined strategies.

RiskManagementModule: Monitors portfolio exposure and ensures compliance with thresholds.

OrderManagementModule: Places, modifies, and cancels orders on exchanges.

ArbitrageModule: Detects arbitrage opportunities across exchanges.

PortfolioManagementModule: Tracks balances, positions, and historical PnL.

LoggingMonitoringSystem: Records bot actions and facilitates debugging.

3. Supporting Infrastructure

These ensure scalability, persistence, and optional data sharing/aggregation:

CentralServer: Aggregates anonymized data for optimization.

BacktestingModule: Simulates trading strategies using historical data.

MachineLearningModule (Planned): Adds predictive capabilities and strategy optimization.

ComplianceModule (Planned): Ensures regulatory adherence and automates tax reporting.

Full Stack Recommendations for Each Module

Front End Modules

GUI

Purpose: Provide a dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.

Stack:

Frontend Framework: React.js, Vue.js, or Angular (for dynamic, interactive UIs).

Charting Library: D3.js or Plotly (for candlestick charts, equity curves, etc.).

API Integration: Axios or Fetch API (for communicating with the back end).

Hosting: Vercel or Netlify (for fast deployment of static front-end assets).

NotificationModule

Purpose: Sends alerts via multiple communication channels (email, Telegram, etc.).

Stack:

Notification Service APIs:

Email: SendGrid or Postmark.

Telegram/Discord: Direct Bot API integration.

SMS: Twilio.

Cloud Integration: AWS SNS or Firebase Cloud Messaging (to centralize notification handling).

Back End Modules

DataFeedModule

Purpose: Fetch real-time and historical market data.

Stack:

Programming Language: Python (with ccxt for exchange APIs or WebSocket handling).

API Gateway: FastAPI or Flask (for exposing endpoints).

Hosting: AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions (for serverless real-time data fetching).

Database: InfluxDB or PostgreSQL (for storing historical data).

PricingStrategyModule

Purpose: Calculate bid/ask prices using market data and strategies.

Stack:

Programming Language: Python (to leverage machine learning or predefined logic).

AI Integration: OpenAI API (for dynamic strategy tuning).

API Framework: Flask or FastAPI (to expose pricing logic as an API).

Hosting: Dockerized service hosted on AWS ECS or Azure App Service.

RiskManagementModule

Purpose: Monitor exposure, ensure order compliance, and generate alerts for risks.

Stack:

Programming Language: Python (for logic implementation and integrations).

Real-Time Data Processing: Celery + RabbitMQ (for async risk checks).

Hosting: Google Cloud Run (auto-scalable backend for risk checks).

Alert Integration: Links with NotificationModule.

OrderManagementModule

Purpose: Place, modify, and cancel orders on exchanges.

Stack:

Exchange API Library: ccxt (to interact with multiple exchanges).

Order Tracking Database: Redis or PostgreSQL (to track order states).

API Framework: Flask or FastAPI.

Hosting: AWS Lambda or Kubernetes (scalable deployment).

ArbitrageModule

Purpose: Detect arbitrage opportunities across exchanges.

Stack:

Programming Language: Python (for latency-sensitive calculations).

Database: MongoDB (for storing fee structures and historical opportunities).

Hosting: Dockerized service running on DigitalOcean or Azure.

PortfolioManagementModule

Purpose: Track balances, positions, and historical PnL.

Stack:

Programming Language: Python or Node.js.

Database: TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension for time-series data).

API Framework: Django REST Framework (for structured data serving).

Hosting: AWS RDS for the database, AWS Lambda for serverless computation.

LoggingMonitoringSystem

Purpose: Record bot actions and display logs for debugging.

Stack:

Logging Framework: Python logging module or Loguru.

Centralized Logging: Elastic Stack (ELK: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

Hosting: Elasticsearch Service on AWS or GCP.

Supporting Infrastructure

CentralServer

Purpose: Aggregate anonymized data for fee and arbitrage optimization.

Stack:

Backend Framework: Node.js or Python Flask.

Database: Firebase Realtime Database or MongoDB.

API Hosting: AWS API Gateway or Azure API Management.

BacktestingModule

Purpose: Simulate trading strategies using historical data.

Stack:

Backtesting Library: Backtrader or custom Python implementation.

Database: SQLite or PostgreSQL (for storing strategy results).

Visualization: Matplotlib or Plotly (to display equity curves).

Hosting: Local for MVP; can migrate to AWS Batch for scalable simulations.

MachineLearningModule (Planned)

Purpose: Predict trends and optimize strategies.

Stack:

ML Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Data Pipeline: Apache Kafka (for real-time data streams).

Hosting: Google AI Platform or AWS SageMaker.

ComplianceModule (Planned)

Purpose: Ensure adherence to regulations.

Stack:

Programming Language: Python.

Data Tracking: MongoDB or TimescaleDB.

Tax Reporting API: Integrate with third-party tax services (e.g., CoinTracking).

Summary of MVP Prioritization

For an MVP, you can focus on:

Core Front End: GUI with React.js + Charting using Plotly.

Core Back End Modules:

DataFeedModule.

OrderManagementModule.

PortfolioManagementModule.

RiskManagementModule.

Hosting: Serverless options (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run) for scalability and cost efficiency.

This approach enables rapid development and integration while keeping the system modular and cloud-friendly.
